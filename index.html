        <h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
        <h4>by Queen</h4>
        <p>
            Is this the real life?<br>
            Is this just fantasy?<br>
            Caught in a landslide,<br>
            no escape from reality.<br>
            Open your eyes,<br>
            look up to the skies and see.<br>
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br>
            Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br>
            little high, little low.<br>
            Anyway the wind blows<br>
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>
            <br>
            Mama<br>
            just killed a man<br>
            Put a gun against his head<br>
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.<br>
            Mama, life had just begun<br>
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br>
            Mama, ooh,<br>
            didn't mean to make you cry,<br>
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br>
            Carry on, carry on,<br>
            as if nothing really matters.<br>
        </p>
